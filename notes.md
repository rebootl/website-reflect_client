## Development

### Technologies

Frontend: Vue.js, axios

Backend: flask, sqlite, peewee

- really glad I found peewee, didn't like sqlalchemy when I checked it out last time, that was some time ago tho

- flask-jwt-extended, +1 ,didn't like flask-jwt, forces me to create object, weird stuff...
created a PKGBUILD for it --> evtl. upload to the AUR
